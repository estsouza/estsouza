# Hi, I'm Esteban

I'm a data analyst. I started my professional journey as an agronomist providing remote sensing derived solutions for agriculture. Some years ago I discovered I loved coding and pulling information out of a bunch of data. Nowadays I have a role as a data analyst in Bayer, although I also carry out some tasks that would fit better in a data scientist role.
